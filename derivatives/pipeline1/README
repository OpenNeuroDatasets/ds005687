The `pipeline1` dataset corresponds to the result of the preprocessing that transforms all recordings into the Tohoku template and coregister rs-fMRIs. 

Matlab templates using SPM 12.0 are given in /code. 
A multiplication by 10 is done for using SPM algorithms. 
A renormalisation using a division by 10 to recover dimensions in mm is done. 
All affines are in mm in a RAS coordinate system. 

The perf suffix is used for the cerebral blood flow perfusion computed according to the algorithms described in

## Movement evaluation during resting state fMRI

Coregistration outputs, known as the [realignment parameters](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/docs/tutorials/fmri/event/preprocessing/#realignment), are given in `sub-<label>/func/sub-<label>_task-rest_mov.tsv`. 
At this time there is no consensus in BIDS about the name of the files containing motion parameters (see also BEP012). 
These files can be used to evaluate movements from an initial volume chosen for reference (see publication for details). 
Measures in x, y and z that are given in the mov files should be divided by 10 to get values in mm. 
Indeed, metrics have been multiplied by 10 during preprocessing step 0 to be compatible with SPM algorithms developped for human acquisitions. 
Also, the initial referential system was +x right, +y anterior, +z superior and the values given here have not been corrected (the pipeline have not been revised with images in the conventional coordinate map system used in the corrected Gin atlas). 

## Gin atlas coordinate system

Finally, the images have been transformed into the 2024 Gin atlas, obtained from the Tohoku atlas, with a conventional coordinate map system RAS with origin at Bregma.
Affines in all volumes are set back to natural mm, avoiding SPM artefacts - values needing to be multiplied by 10 to be compatible with the processing of human data.
